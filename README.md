# Welcome to r4greg

Welcome to the workshop! This lesson will build on the basic **ggplot2** vocabulary you learned in [part 1 of the workshop](http://github.com/paleolimbot/r4ags) to help make your plots look the way you want them to. [Click here](https://rstudio.cloud/project/342897) to launch an RStudio IDE pre-loaded with today's exercise.

### Learner persona for this exercise

Lauren works for a provincial geological survey and has a M.Sc. in Geology. She has much experience in Excel, and learned statistics with Minitab in her undergraduate degree. Lauren would like to use R to do more sophisticated analysis with the provincial survey data, and has heard that learning R will be helpful to further her career. While she tends learn things quickly, she often has difficulty asking for help.
